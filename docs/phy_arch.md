# PHY Architecture

## TX serializer

* Shift register vs. tree?
* Jitter specs?

## TX driver

* Separate IO voltage?
* CMOS vs N/N?
* Impedance control?
* Equalization?
* Edge rate control?
* Active vs passive termination?

## PLL

* Ring oscillator vs LC?
* Required frequency (half-rate vs quarter-rate)?
* Jitter specs?

## Channel

* Number/density of return lines?
* S-parameter model?

## DLL/PI

* Jitter specs?
* Per lane skew?

## RX

* Required pre-amp?
* Equalization?
* Offset correction?

## Duty cycle correction

* Where does this need to be placed?
